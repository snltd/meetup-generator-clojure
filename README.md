# meetup-generator

A Clojure port of my [meetup generator](https://meetup.sysdef.xyz).

It's the first "proper" thing I've written in Clojure, and I expect
I've got everything wrong.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above installed.

[leiningen]: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server
